Basis elements of the algebra are referred to by their degree and index, and general elements are referred to by the degree and an `FpVector` listing the coefficients of the element in terms of the basis."],["AlgebraWithGenerators","An `AlgebraWithGenerators` is an algebra with a specified choice of algebra generators. It gives us a simpler way of describing finite modules by only specifying the action of the generators."]]});
