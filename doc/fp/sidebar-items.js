initSidebarItems({"mod":[["matrix",""],["prime",""],["vector","An `FpVector` is a vector with entries in Fp. We use this instead of `Vec<u32>` because we can pack a lot of entries into a single `u64`, especially for p small. This not only saves memory, but also leads to faster addition, for example (e.g. a single ^ can add 64 elements of F2 at the same time)."]]});
